<!-- # Integrating Classification, Localization, and Segmentation through Lock-Release Pretraining Strategy for Chest X-ray Analysis -->

Developing deep-learning models for medical imaging requires large, annotated datasets, but the heterogeneity of annotations across tasks presents significant challenges. Foundation X is an end-to-end framework designed to train a multi-task foundation model by leveraging diverse expert-level annotations from multiple public datasets. It introduces a Cyclic & Lock-Release pretraining strategy alongside a student-teacher learning paradigm to enhance knowledge retention while mitigating overfitting. Trained on 11 chest X-ray datasets, Foundation X seamlessly integrates classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to maximize annotation utility, improve cross-dataset and cross-task learning, and achieve superior performance in disease classification, localization, and segmentation.

    <br/><em>We pretrain our Foundation X model using [11 publicly available chest X-ray datasets](https://github.com/jlianglab/Foundation_X/blob/main/Figures/Foundation_X_Dataset_Collection.png), as shown in the first 11 datasets in the table. Although not every dataset contains all three types of annotations—classification, localization, and segmentation—we leverage all available annotations to maximize the model’s learning potential. Among these datasets, all include classification ground truths, six provide localization bounding box annotations, and three offer segmentation masks for diseases. Furthermore, we utilize organ localization and segmentation datasets from VinDr-CXR, VinDr-RibCXR, NIH Montgomery, and JSRT for target task fine-tuning. Here, the organ segmentation masks for VinDr-CXR were sourced from the CheXmask database. We also fine-tuned VinDr-CXR with local labels for the disease localization task.</em>

## Data Splits and Bounding Box Annotations
- Data splits and generated COCO-format localization bouding box annotation files can be downloaded through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/wdiq3s6SNvsd6nn78). <br/>

## Pre-trained models
- You can download the pretrained models through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/7ynYFcoiKYYwQNWG8).

## Setting-up the multiscaledeformableattention package
- Please follow the steps described in [DINO GitHub Repo](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO) to install the package "multiscaledeformableattention".

## Pretraining Instructions
- Follow the script [`scripts/run_IntegratedModel_Foundation6_ClsLocSeg_v102.sh`](https://github.com/jlianglab/Foundation_X/blob/main/scripts/run_IntegratedModel_Foundation6_ClsLocSeg_v102.sh) to start pretraining **Foundation X model**. <br/>
- Make sure to update the data direcotry in the files [`datasets/coco.py`](https://github.com/jlianglab/Foundation_X/blob/main/datasets/coco.py) (for localization tasks) and [`datasets_medical.py`](https://github.com/jlianglab/Foundation_X/blob/main/datasets_medical.py) (for classification and segmentation tasks). <br/>
- If Classification Heads need to be increased or decreased the file [`models/dino/swin_transformer_CyclicSegmentation.py`](https://github.com/jlianglab/Foundation_X/blob/main/models/dino/swin_transformer_CyclicSegmentation.py#L637) should be modified.
- If Segmentation Heads need to be increased or decreased the file [`models/dino/swin_transformer_CyclicSegmentation.py`](https://github.com/jlianglab/Foundation_X/blob/main/models/dino/swin_transformer_CyclicSegmentation.py#L672) should be modified.
- The Localization branch is based on [DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO). We modified the code to have multiple Localization Decoders. If the number of Localization Decoders needs to be adjusted, the following code snippet must be modified. Currently, the code reflects 6 Localization Decoders. <br/>
